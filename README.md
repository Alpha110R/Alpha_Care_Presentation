Do you have a furry friend at home? Do you also happen to own an Android device? Excellent!

Introducing my first app, Alpha Care: Manage Pet's Life, now available on Google Play! It's the ultimate app for pet owners, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you. 🐶🐱

🐾 Share your furry friend with other members of your pack.

🐾 Track in real-time who took care of your pet and when.

🐾 Keep a record of your pet's activity history.

Easily manage your pet's daily needs with my app's intuitive and user-friendly interface.
